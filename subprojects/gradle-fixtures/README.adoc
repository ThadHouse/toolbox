= Gradle TestKit Fixtures

These are fixtures for accelerating your Gradle plugin development.
These fixtures are mostly extracted from https://github.com/gradle/gradle[Gradle code base].
The main goal is to extract what is required for the all plugin authors.

== How to use?

Add the repository to your build script:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://dl.bintray.com/gradle-plugins/maven")
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to your functional tests:

```
dependencies {
    // See https://bintray.com/gradle-plugins/maven/testkit-fixtures for the latest version
    functionalTestImplementation("dev.gradleplugins:gradle-testkit-fixtures:0.0.21")
}
```
